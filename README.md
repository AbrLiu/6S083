# 6.S083 / 18.S190 - Introduction to Computational Thinking with Julia, with applications to modelling the COVID-19 pandemic

## Spring 2020

Welcome to 6.S083 / 18.S190 (dual listed)! This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the Julia programming language, with applications to modelling the COVID-19 epidemic.
It is being taught at MIT in the 2nd half of the spring 2020 semester.

### Professors
Visiting Professor David P. Sanders ([sandersd@mit.edu](mailto:sandersd@mit.edu)) & Professor Alan Edelman

### Lectures
MW 3 - 4.30, online. (Registered students will receive a Zoom link.)

Lectures will be mostly live at the above times, with recordings posted when available. There will be some pre-recorded snippets.

Start date: March 30, 2020.

### Install Julia
You will need to install Julia, and various packages by carefully following the detailed instructions [here](installation.md).
(Note that you do not need to separately install the Jupyter notebook -- it will be installed for you as part of the installation process. It is possible to use a pre-existing installation, but we recommend against it. This will install a new, separate copy of it.)

### Discussion forum

### Office hours
TBD

### Evaluation

*   5 problem sets, 20% each. Lowest score dropped.

*   To pass, you must submit at least 4 problem sets with passing grades

*   No final exam

Problem sets consist of coding and will be submitted online.



### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/mitmath/6S083
```
This will create a new directory called `6S083` with the matierials.


- Update it to pull in new changes
```
git pull
```
This needs to be executed from within the directory. (Use `cd` to change directory.)
